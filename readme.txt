Get accurate and beautiful weather forecasts powered by Wunderground.com for your content or your sidebar.

== Description ==

<blockquote><p>"[WP Wunderground] is by far, the best weather plugin i've ever seen on a CMS before. Not even Joomla has something so powerful, good looking and yet easy to implement."<br /><cite>Robson</cite></p></blockquote>

<h3>Wunderground is the best WordPress weather site.</h3>

Wunderground.com has the most accurate and in-depth weather information. They're also not evil corporate giants, and are weather geeks, which is nice. 

This plugin uses the Wunderground API to gather its accurate forecasts.

<h3>If you want a great-looking weather forecast, use this plugin.</h3>
__This is the best-looking weather forecast plugin for WordPress.__ It looks great on many different templates out of the box, including the default WP theme, TwentyTen.

###Why would I want this plugin?
This plugin is a perfect compliment for regional websites (about a city or town), personal websites where you want to share what the weather is like where you're blogging from, travel sites (show the weather at each stop!), <a href="http://www.denversnowremovalservice.com">snow removal</a> websites, yard services websites, and more.

The WP Wunderground plugin uses 10 great-looking icon sets from Wunderground.com, including: 

* <a href="http://icons-ecast.wxug.com/i/c/a/clear.gif" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Default</a>

<h3>Using the WP Wunderground Weather Plugin</h3>
The plugin can be configured in two ways: 

1. Configure the plugin in the admin's WP Wunderground settings page, then add `[forecast]` to your content where you want the forecast to appear.
2. Go crazy with the `[forecast]` shortcode.

<h4>Using the `[forecast]` Shortcode</h4>
If you're a maniac for shortcodes, and you want all control all the time, this is a good way to use it.

`[forecast location="Tokyo, Japan" caption="Weather for Tokyo" measurement='F' todaylabel="Today" datelabel="date('m/d/Y')" highlow='%%high%%&deg;/%%low%%&deg;' numdays="3" iconset="Cartoon" class="css_table_class"]`

<strong>The shortcode supports the following settings:</strong>

* `location="Tokyo, Japan"` - Use any city/state combo or US/Canada ZIP code
* `caption="Weather for Tokyo"` - Add a caption to your table (it's like a title) 
* `measurement='F'` - Choose Fahrenheit or Celsius by using "F" or "C"
* `datelabel="date('m/d/Y')"` - Format the way the days display ("9/30/2012" in this example)
* `todaylabel="Today"` - Format how today's date appears ("Today" in this example)
* `highlow='%%high%%&deg;/%%low%%&deg;'` - Format how the highs & low temps display ("85&deg;/35&deg;" in this example)
* `numdays=3` - Change the number of days displayed in the forecast. Up to 6 day forecast.
* `iconset="Cartoon"` - Choose your iconset from one of 10 great options
* `class="css_table_class"` - Change the CSS class of the generated forecast table

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= How do I use my own icons? =

If you want to use your own icons, you would add a filter to the bottom of your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file:

<h3>Version 1.2+</h3>
<pre>
add_filter('wp_wunderground_forecast_icon', 'use_custom_wunderground_icons');

function use_custom_wunderground_icons($content=null) { 
	
	$myIconFolder = 'http://www.example.com/images/';
	
	$myFileType = '.gif';
	
	$content = preg_replace('/http\:\/\/icons\-ecast\.wxug\.com\/i\/c\/[a-z]\/(.*?)\.gif/ism', $myIconFolder.'$1'.$myFileType, $content);
	
	return $content;
}
</pre>

<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
<pre>
add_filter('wp_wunderground_forecast', 'use_custom_wunderground_icons');

function use_custom_wunderground_icons($content=null) { 
	
	$myIconFolder = 'http://www.example.com/images/';
	
	$myFileType = '.gif';
	
	$content = preg_replace('/http\:\/\/icons\-ecast\.wxug\.com\/i\/c\/[a-z]\/(.*?)\.gif/ism', $myIconFolder.'$1'.$myFileType, $content);
	
	return $content;
}
</pre>

= I am unable to activate the plugin. = 
This plugin requires PHP5, and Version 1.0 does not check for PHP compatibility. In future versions, it will show a more meaningful error and also support PHP 4.

For now, however, options are to upgrade the version of PHP (contact your web host) or to not use the plugin.

= I want to modify the forecast output. How do I do that? =

<pre>
function replace_weather($content) {
	$content = str_replace('Rain', 'RAYNNNNN!', $content);
	$content = str_replace('Snow', 'SNNNOOOO!', $content);
	return $content;
}
add_filter('wp_wunderground_forecast', 'replace_weather');
</pre>

= What is the plugin license? =

* This plugin is released under a GPL license.

= Do I need a Wunderground account? =
Nope, no account needed.

= This plugin slows down my site. =
Version 1.1 of the plugin added forecast caching, so the forecast is only re-loaded every 6 hours.

For previous versions, it is recommended to use a caching plugin (such as WP Super Cache) with this plugin; that way the forecast isn't re-loaded every page load.
