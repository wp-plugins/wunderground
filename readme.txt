== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the settings page? =

Version 2.0 got rid of the default settings page; now shortcodes and widgets are configured individually.

= My forecast looks different! =

Version 2.0 made lots of changes as to how the forecast is displayed. You can download the last update of the "1.x" version of the plugin here: **[Version 1.2.5.1](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wunderground.1.2.5.1.zip)**

= How do I use my own icons? =

If you want to use your own icons, you would add a filter to the bottom of your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file. See a [list of icons you should have available](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=resources/icon). Here's sample code:

<pre>
add_filter('wp_wunderground_forecast_icon', 'use_custom_wunderground_icons', 10, 2 );

function use_custom_wunderground_icons( $url_base = '', $icon_name = '' ) {
	return 'http://www.example.com/path-to-full-icon-set/';
}
</pre>

= I want to modify the forecast output. How do I do that? =

Please see the "Using your own template" section on the [Plugin Github page](https://github.com/katzwebservices/Wunderground)

= What is the plugin license? =

This plugin is released under a GPL license. *Weather Underground is a registered trademark of The Weather Channel, LLC. both in the United States and internationally. The Weather Underground Logo is a trademark of Weather Underground, LLC.*

== Changelog ==

* Added: `wunderground_twig_debug` filter. You can force Twig debug mode by adding `add_filter( 'wunderground_twig_debug' '__return_true' );` to your theme's `functions.php` file. You can also enable debug mode if you're logged in as an Administrator by adding `?debug` to your current page's URL.

= 1.2.4 =
* Removed error generation when XML file cannot be read (Error on line 427, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/506565" rel="nofollow">as reported</a>). Now, it just outputs an HTML comment error message.

	* If you want to refresh the results, you can add `?cache=false` to your URL and the forecast will be updated.

* Changed the default high/low setting to add the degree symbol.
* Removed code whitespace when storing table for added speed
* Added CSS classes to forecast columns based on weather conditions. This will allow you to make "Partly Cloudy" columns gray, "Sunny" blue, etc.

	* `wp_wunderground_forecast_cache` - How long results are cached for. Default: 6 hours.
	* `wp_wunderground_forecast_icon`
	* `wp_wunderground_forecast_conditions`
	* `wp_wunderground_forecast_temp`
* Rounded column width to two digits. Instead of `16.66666667%`, it's now `16.67%`

= 1.1 =
* Added data storage - the plugin will now store forecast tables for 6 hours. This should speed up the time it takes to load the forecasts.
